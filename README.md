Smartsheet form: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/1d501efc3c774374ae5be89f3c135451

Smartsheet grid – sorry, this is very hacky at the moment and not accessible. I'll fix it in the next iteration: https://contentwise.org.uk/concon

Don't get too excited. This didn't really work in the session. I tried to control the Smartsheet too tightly with ID numbers that correspond to rows. 70% of participants submitted an idea (which was amazing) but the gaps threw the ordering. I think it could work with a few more tries.
